      <strong> javascript</strong> is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely 
      used for developing various applications, including web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise applications. 
      It was first released by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995. Java is known for 
      its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) approach, which allows developers to write code once and run it 
      on any platform that supports Java without the need for recompilation.
