      <strong>PHP </strong>(Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used server-side scripting language
       primarily designed for web development. It is embedded in HTML code and executed on the server, 
       generating dynamic content that is then sent to the client's web browser. PHP is open-source, 
       meaning it is free to use and has a large and active community of developers.
